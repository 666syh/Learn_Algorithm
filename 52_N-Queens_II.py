"""
The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens 
on an n√ón chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer n, return the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Example:

    Input: 4
    Output: 2
    Explanation: There are two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown below.
    [
     [".Q..",  // Solution 1
      "...Q",
      "Q...",
      "..Q."],

     ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
      "Q...",
      "...Q",
      ".Q.."]
    ]
